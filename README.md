# READMINE: Mode Changer



## Introduction

This program uses any .mxl(Music XML) file and changes it to a different mode.


## Installation

There isn't really anything to install here, instead you can find my code working on a Streamlit app at:
https://modechanger.streamlit.app/


## Quick start

Have a .mxl(Music XML) file on hand, as well as knowing what Major key it is in(Even if it is minor!) Then go to the app and import it in. After filling in the text boxes, press the change mode button and download it as a changed MIDI or .mxl


## Known issues and limitations

Currently it does not work with quite a bit of keys, mainly things with a sharp or flat. I also have not worked around double sharps/flats so anything requiring that will not work either.


## License

Free Use! Have fun.
